				My name is Christopher Bravo, and my experiences with web design so far have been pretty limited. 
        I'm trying to get a lot of practice done here so that I can become a lot more elegant when I 
        build websites in other situations.
			</p>
			<p> 
				In any case, this website will hopefully continue to grow every day. 
        You can expect to see a lot of boring stuff for now, but this likely won't be the case for too long.
