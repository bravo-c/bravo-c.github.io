				Hello, World! My name is Christopher Bravo and I am nineteen years old. 
				I graduated from New Paltz High School when I was seventeen, and now I'm 
				studying at Northeastern University. For many years, school was what my life was about.
				Pursuit of knowledge was pretty much everything to me - even now, it's the focus of my life.
				My hope is that in time, I'll find things to do that I'm really passionate about. 
				Because thus far, doing my best to make friends and to enjoy time with my family is all
				that I have found. Looking forward to making that list longer every day.
			</p>

			<p> 
				In any case, thanks for reading along. If you'd like to contact me for any reason, 
				you can reach me at my email bravo.c@husky.neu.edu!
