				Hi! My name is Christopher Bravo and I am <span id="age">nineteen</span> years old. 
				I graduated from New Paltz High School when I was seventeen, and now I'm 
				studying Computer Science and Cognitive Psychology at Northeastern University.
				
			</p>
			<p>
				Also, I wanted to include a download link to a game I made, the game is only executable on Unix systems 
				at the moment. Sorry! <a href=thrive-v2 download>Link</a> 
			</p>
			<p>
				To get it to run, you'll have to do the following actions:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li> Download the game from the link above </li>
				<li> Open the terminal or equivalent. </li>
				<li> Run the command "chmod +x <PATH_NAME>" to make the file an executable.
					<PATH_NAME> should be replaced by the path to your file - this will be something
						like "/Users/Jess/Downloads/thrive-v2"</li>
				<li> Now you should be able to double-click the game and run it. If you have any trouble 
					getting the game to run, just let me know! </li>
			</ol>
